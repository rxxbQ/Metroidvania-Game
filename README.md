Level Up: Use coins to level up at the save points. Each level requires more coins to level up. You can earn coins by opening chest or defeating enemies. You can choose to level up one of the following attributes at each level.

          Health -> increase maximum HP
          Mana -> increase maximum MP
          Stamina -> increase maximum stamina
          Attack -> increase attack damage
          Defence -> increase defence to block more damage from enemies
          Luck -> increase drop rate

UI: 

    HP -> When hp goes down to zero, you have one chance to revive from the same spot you died by having half of your maximum hp as your current hp. If you die again you will respawn from the save point and lose half of your current gold.

    Mana -> You can use mana to trade for more ranged weapons.
    
    Stamina ->  Stamina will regenerate itself continuously until it becomes full. Each time you slide or attack, you reduce stamina. When you stamina gose down to zero, you are not able to attack until it becomes full. However, even you are not able to attck, you are still able to slide. 
    
    Items -> It takes 1.5s to consume potions or powerups. During that time it you take damage then the casting will be canceled. You can use items by opening inventory then click on the items. Or you can select items to use by '↑', '↓' then quickcast by 'Q', 'E'.
